# software

I like to use simple, [free and open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) software.

In my spare time I like to write software. I think programming is a great hobby.
It's like building machines, except you don't need to deal with the unreliable
and expensive nature of physical materials.

Most of my software can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/tteeoo).
In the future I will likely post some of the things I have made on this website.
