# Treatise on the Interactions of Lysergic Acid diethylamide (LSD) and Theodore Henson [TILATH]: beyond Acid

by Theodore Henson

## Introduction

By whatever means that individuals typically find themselves in the position of
ingesting Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) [that is to say, the means don't 
particularly matter] I (the individual, Theodore Henson) also have.

### A note on the timeliness of the events in question

I have started my ingestion (to imply that I have not stopped occasional
ingestion into future years) in the year 2023. Such a year is far past (in terms
of human lifespan) the moment of not only LSD's original synthesis (to my knowledge,
that is to say by the metric I deem as Albert Hofmann of Switzerland in 1938) and the particular
substance's first documented ingestion (that again of Hofmann but in 1943 [
This difference in time is of interest in its indication of his approach to the
substance as a chemist and his accidental later ingestion thereby discovering
its subjective properties.]).

Such a year of 2023 is also notable in being past the cultural movement known as
postmodernism (a vague yet seemingly useful term that I do not seek to define,
regarded as being contained within the 20th century)
and many of its ideological facets being imbibed into popular consciousness.
Such facets include the widening of a conception of art and relationships among humans,
the general suspicion against grand governing narratives, as well as (perhaps as a consequence)
the seemingly more-often-now-than-previously dysphoric existential wondering of
individuals (and therefore I am led to assume that popular consciousness has also been wondering
existentially as of late [in terms of humanity's lifespan, which seemingly may end sooner than later
due to human-induced climate change]).

The beats->(CIA)->hippies

Now, social media (or better encapsulated, individual media?)

### On the existence of other similar substances

### On my circumstances

### On "society"

Throughout TILATH I will refer to an entity known as "society".
By this I mean not only the general idea of a system of humans 
interacting with each other, 

### On typical terminology and mental paraphernalia

## Part One

## Part Two

On acid I become the universal human (within my largest society).

### On Subconsious Knowledge

### On "Kant"
